# TXParentingOrder
Layout mock-up for a human-readable summary of a Texas parenting and child custody order.

Written for [Tech for Justice](http://www.techforjustice.org/) in Austin, February 21-22, 2015.

Based on a sample parenting order provided by the [Texas Legal Services Center](http://tlsc.org/).

This partial mock-up is only for use as a starting point for designers. It doesn't reflect a real order, and it shouldn't be relied upon as a source of information!
